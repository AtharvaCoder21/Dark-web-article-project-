        There are a number of key benefits to implementing dark web monitoring as a part of your organization’s cybersecurity strategy, below are four main benefits: 
<li>
1. Increases the chances of identifying and reducing the impact of data breaches Dark web monitoring involves scans that scour the dark web for stolen customer lists or data, employee login credentials, and the business’s email domains and IP addresses. If this information is discovered to exist on the dark web it can help your organization identify an ongoing data breach or a data breach that has occurred in the past, by identifying these attacks early, an organization can mitigate damages to finances and reputation. 
</li><li>
2. Dark web monitoring can better prepare organizations for future threats

By scanning the dark web, organizations can learn of past breaches and what data was stolen. Information Security teams can identify which systems were compromised and how exactly vulnerabilities were manipulated by attackers. Using this information organizations can create a robust action plan on how to prevent future attacks from happening. 
</li><li>
3. Dark web monitoring can help organisation safeguard their employee and client data 

Dark web scans can help identify sensitive information of employees or clients that end up on the dark web, this knowledge can then be used to stop criminals from exploiting stolen information that ends up on the dark web. 
</li><li>
4. Help organizations reduce the time between a data breach occurring and finding out that it occurred

Without dark web monitoring, organizations can spend a long time in the unknown after a data breach occurs, 24/7 monitoring of the dark web enables organizations to promptly identify when their sensitive information falls into the hands of criminals. This in turn also helps organization reduce the overall window of opportunity a criminal has to make copies of sensitive data and sell it.
